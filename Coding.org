* Generate compile_commands.json for language server protocol

You can generate =compile_commands.json= by running =cmake= with option =-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1= as follows.

#+begin_src sh
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 ..
#+end_src

You can make a symbolic link to it.

#+begin_src sh
  ln -s build/compile_commands.json .
#+end_src
