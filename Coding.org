* Coding memo

This memo provides tips for coding.

* Format Source code format

You can format source code via =clang-format= as follows.

#+begin_src sh
  clang-format -i *.c
#+end_src

You can also generate a format config file via =clang-format= as follows.

#+begin_src sh
  clang-format -style=llvm -dump-config > .clang-format
#+end_src

* Generate compile_commands.json for language server protocol

You can generate =compile_commands.json= by running =cmake= with option =-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1= as follows.

#+begin_src sh
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 ..
#+end_src

You can make a symbolic link to it.

#+begin_src sh
  ln -s build/compile_commands.json .
#+end_src
